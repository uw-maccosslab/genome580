# Genome 580
Genome 580: Ethics

# Course Description
This course explores ethical issues in research and teaching and discusses avenues of responsible conduct. Intended for Genome Sciences grads and others supported by departmental training grants. 

# Class Format
Most classes will be focused on a discussion with the instructor and guest faculty discussant(s). There will be assigned readings for each topic, and I will put those on the class website several days prior to the class. Please print those and bring them to class.  We will also have some questions to structure the discussion, but your thoughts and questions aired in the discussion are the heart of the class. For some classes we will break into subgroups to have a more focused discussion.

# Instructor
Michael MacCoss, Ph.D.

# Course Materials
We do not use a textbook. There will be assigned readings from the literature, perspectives, and/or free online sources.
